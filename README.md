# PyCity Schools Analysis

- The purpose of this analysis was to have strong data to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and prioroties.

- We started with district-wide standartized test results. We were analyzing the difference betweem District and Charter schools. Where we found out that highest performing schools are charter and bottom one are district ones. 


- We were focused on budget per school impact and per student. We can see Charter - Cabrera High School with total students of 1858 and 3x smaller spending budget comparing to District - Bailey High School with almost 5k students have %Overal Passing 91% comparing to almost 55% for Bailey. With Cabrera's $40 smaller budget per student it does not seem the funds have any positive impact.

- Smaller school and budget, higher results in math and reading scores. Charter schools outperform District schools. The passing rate in Math and Reading increase with less student per school.


- Students have better results in reading comparing to math score.

- We were not able to find out how the funds from the budget per student are being used. Based on the data we could perform some visualization graphs to see easier comparison. It might benefit the District schools to have smaller classes or have additional classes in the afternoon, perhaps more homeworks, or use different techniques and studying materials.
